# Hey, I'm Sean Fitzgerald

Welcome to my corner of GitHub!

I'm a Computer Science student at **NYIT**, diving deep into the world of **Artificial Intelligence**.

Right now, I'm working as a **Mobile App Developer** at **EVERYTHINGCARS WEB ELITES**. I'm focused on building the **EverythingCars**, a social media platform for car enthusiasts. It's a full-stack role, so I get to do everything from planning the UI to building out the backend.

## Some Things I've Built

### F1 Race Control Discord Bot
* I built this bot in **Python** to pull F1 race control updates from API endpoints and send them straight to a Discord server.
* It's deployed on **AWS** to make sure it's always online during a race weekend.
* I'm particularly proud that I was able to program it to know when a race was active, which cut its resource usage by 67%.

### 8 Piece Puzzle Solver
* As part of a two-person team, I co-developed a **Python** algorithm to solve 8-piece puzzles.
* I focused on the efficiency side and managed to help speed up the solver by over 43%.
* It also has a simple front-end built with **HTML, CSS, and Javascript** to connect to the backend.

## Volunteer Work

* **Lead Web Designer @ The Butterfly Brotherhood** (Apr 2022 - Present)
    * I volunteer to help build and maintain the website for this non-profit, which does great work advocating for mental health and wellness.
    * Part of our work involves collecting data that's used in teaching materials at over six local schools.
