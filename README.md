# Hey, I'm Sean Fitzgerald 👋

Welcome to my corner of GitHub!

[cite_start]I'm a Computer Science student at **NYIT**, diving deep into the world of **Artificial Intelligence**[cite: 4, 6].

[cite_start]Right now, I'm working as a **Mobile App Developer** at **EVERYTHINGCARS WEB ELITES**[cite: 19, 20]. [cite_start]I'm focused on building the **EverythingCars iOS app**, a social media platform for car enthusiasts[cite: 23]. It's a full-stack role, so I get to do everything from planning the UI to building out the backend. [cite_start]I've been using **Swift** and **Supabase SQL** to implement features like real-time group messaging, geolocation, user posts, and even an automated AI post creator for events[cite: 23, 26, 27].

## 🚀 Some Things I've Built

*(Feel free to browse the repos for these!)*

### 🏎️ F1 Race Control Discord Bot
* [cite_start]I built this bot in **Python** to pull F1 race control updates from API endpoints and send them straight to a Discord server[cite: 41].
* [cite_start]It's deployed on **AWS** to make sure it's always online during a race weekend[cite: 42].
* [cite_start]I'm particularly proud that I was able to program it to know when a race was active, which cut its resource usage by 67%[cite: 43].

### 🧩 8 Piece Puzzle Solver
* [cite_start]As part of a two-person team, I co-developed a **Python** algorithm to solve 8-piece puzzles[cite: 36].
* [cite_start]I focused on the efficiency side and managed to help speed up the solver by over 43%[cite: 37].
* [cite_start]It also has a simple front-end built with **HTML, CSS, and Javascript** to connect to the backend[cite: 38].
